archisogen

Description

archisogen is a small program to generate base file folders for Arch Linux
ISO creation using the archiso package from the arch repo.

I found the need to create this simple program, due to lack of rebuilding the .iso
after the initial build. archisogen simply lets you configure the iso in a separate
folder, and make test builds in temperary directories for you to run. You can then
edit further and make a new folder and test again, without moving files around all
the time. 

When the build turns out to be exactly what you wanted, you can simply tar the 
'~/archisoconfig' folder and git it or whatever. Mission accomplished.

This is only made for own productivity and is a ruff and far from optimal solution.
If you need this process to be expanded, it can easily be done from the basics of
these files. 

I might expand the program to take a --conf-folder or something to make it sligtly
more convinient, but hey, just tar up when you're done.. no biggy :) Time will show.
I don't really need it :P


Usage

First of all you should run the archisocreate to check for archiso and also create some folders and files in your 
/root/ directory:

archie ~$ ./archisocreate 

This will install the package, and then copy editable files into '/root/archisoconfig',

It will also copy the 'archisogen' file to '/usr/bin'.

NB! This files must be manually deleted as for now, if you do not want to continue making arch isos!

Now to make a build..

You should always configure your iso image as root!

Su as root and cd to ~archisoconfig directory. From there you can edit and add files 
according to the Arch wiki. This is fairly straight forward..

Put name of desired packages into packages.both or packages.architecture files (one 
name per line), and you're done. 

To run things normally run after a normal install, simply put the commands into the
file ~/archisoconfig/airootfs/root/custominstallscript.sh and this will be run during
the building of the .iso file, which is the last step.

The ~/archisoconfig/airootfs/ folder is to be thought of as the / of the .iso 
folder structure. This means that ~/archisoconfig/airootfs/home/archie/ would be 
archies home folder and so on.

When everything is configured the way you want it, and all packages needed has been 
put into the packages files you can go on to create the build folder. Go to your 
home directory (still as root user) and run archisogen:

root ~/archisoconfig$ cd ~

root ~$ archisogen arch-makerspace

You will then get a message when it is done. Then you can cd into arch-makerspace or
whatever you called the build, and start building the .iso image:

root ~$ cd arch-makerspace

root ~/arch-makerspace$ ./build.sh -v

This will take quite some time (depending a lot on how many packages you have choosen).
Feel free to make some coffee, or read up a bit about the archiso on the wiki.
